# Awesome AnimateDiff Tutorial

[English](./README_en.md) [‰∏≠Êñá](./README.md)

Recently, I studied [AnimateDiff](https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff) and summarized its usage for users. From the information I organized, the high-level applications can be divided into three categories:

- cli (https://github.com/s9roll7/animatediff-cli-prompt-travel)
- comfyui (https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved)
- webui (https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-animatediff)
 
The ease of getting started with these tools is ranked as webui > comfyui > cli. There is no replacement among them; my understanding is that the difference lies in the human-computer interaction interface, but all methods can achieve consistent effects. However, the webui plugin currently still has some model gray pictures, but in terms of ecology, webui is more powerful.
